# EcoDrone-UI

To run this code you have to launch a local server. In my case I use python programming languge which is allow an easy to set up server.

In case if you use python (as me) just type this on your command line interface (CLI). Windows has built-in CLI, it is CMD. Before you run a command be sure you are in this project's folder.

```
.../projects_folder/>python -m http.server
```

After you have done with it, open your browser and open localhost:8000 via an address bar. You should see a rotating relief map on your screen.
